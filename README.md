This is the repository that holds my solution. 

# Learning outcomes
This project incorporates vanilla HTML, SASS, and JavaScript DOM Manipulation. I was able to learn how to validate forms using JavaScript. In addition based on the state of the form I was able to display error messages and correct input results.

# Challenges
This project posted a challenge because I had to come up with an email validation algorithm, however I was able to integrate into the application and works.
